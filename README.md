Task 1 Multiplier
To make a multiplier, for this we design the input of two positive integers to a function and this function will process a quantum algorithm that makes the multiplier (see Draper adder) and returns the result in an integer.

you cannot use any implementation already designed by the framework


def multiplier(int:number_1, int ,number_2):
     “””
 number_1 : integer positive value that is the first parameter to the multiplier function,
number_2 : integer positive value that is the second parameter to the multiplier function.
Return the positive integer value of the multiplication between number_1 and number_2
     “””

     # use a framework that works with quantum circuits, qiskit, cirq, pennylane, etc. 


      # define a quantum circuit to convert the integer values in qubits, example bases encoding 
      # basis encoding: n bits are equals to a state of n qubits, example 
      # The integer value 3 convert to a binary string that is 11, the basis encoding is |11⟩
     
      # use the state of the art to check the possibles ways to design a multiplier

  Return # the result of the quantum circuit into an integer value

 consider print your quantum circuit,


Example:

A = multiplier(5,6)
print(A)

30
